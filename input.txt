The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Life is a journey, not a destination.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up.
Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.
May the force be with you.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
All that glitters is not gold.
A watched pot never boils.
Better late than never.
